## Required Libraries
There's are number of libraries that you will need to install using the Arduino Library Manager:
 1. U8g2
 2. FastLED
 3. VoiceRecognitionV3
 4. DFPlayerMini_Fast
 5. ezButton

### Installing U8g2 and required modifications
The U8g2 library has a pretty large program foot print, so we need to make a number of changes to
minimize the size of the program. See https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2optimization for details.
 1. Open <intall directory>/Arduino/libraries/u8g2/src/clib/u8g2.h
 2. Comment out following lines to reduce program size
    - #define U8G2_WITH_INTERSECTION
    - #define U8G2_WITH_CLIP_WINDOW_SUPPORT
    - #define U8G2_WITH_FONT_ROTATION

If you are using the same SH1122 OLED compoment, you'll want to try an minimize 
the noise of the OLED by reducing it's refresh rate and various voltages. Spec 
sheet include the supported commands: https://www.displayfuture.com/Display/datasheet/controller/SH1122.pdf
 1. Open <intall directory>/Arduino/libraries/u8g2/src/clib/u8x8_d_sh1122.c
 2. Find and replace the setting for clock divide ratio and fosc (0xD5)
    - U8X8_CA(0xd5, 0x50) should be U8X8_CA(0xd5, 0x31)
 3. Find and replace the setting for pre-charge (0xDC)
    - U8X8_CA(0xdc, 0x35) should be U8X8_CA(0xdc, 0x1a)

### Voice Recognition module
The voice recognition module is from Elechouse. Their library has to be installed
manually to the Arduino library, and can be found on Github.
 1. Open https://github.com/elechouse/VoiceRecognitionV3
 2. Download the zip or clone the repo
 3. Extract contents into the /Arduino Sketch/libraries directory

Once installed, follow the instructions to train the VR module. You can train up to 7
active voice commands. Train each command using the example sketche that comes with the
library. You can find detailed instructions in the manual or the
[VoiceRecognitionV3 github](https://github.com/elechouse/VoiceRecognitionV3) page, but here's
a few tips to make you successful:
 1. Make sure to change the RX and TX pin based on how you connected it to the Arduino
 2. The commands should be trained based on the programs expected order - defined in config.h
 3. Once all of the commands are trained, update the module to autoload the commands on startup
    - This step is crucual to make the VR module work with this sketch.

#### Training commands
The voice commands must be trained in the expected slots. This is defined in the config.h file
and should not be changed. For reference, see below:
```c++
/**
 *  Voice Recognition Commands.
 *  IMPORTANT - The VR module must be trained this sequence.
 */
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_AP         0 // speak "Armor Piercing" or just "Armor"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_IN         1 // speak "Incendiary"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_HS         2 // speak "Hotshot"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_HE         3 // speak "High Ex"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_ST         4 // speak "Stun"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_FMJ        5 // speak "Full Metal"
#define VR_CMD_AMMO_MODE_RAPID      6 // speak "Rapid"
```

You can find instructions, with pictures, on the [VoiceRecognitionV3 Github](https://github.com/elechouse/VoiceRecognitionV3) page.
 1. Open vr_sample_train (File -> Examples -> VoiceRecognitionV3 -> vr_sample_train)
 2. Choose right Arduino board (Tool -> Board, UNO recommended), Choose right serial port.
 3. Click Upload button, wait until Arduino is uploaded.
 4. Open Serial Monitor. Set baud rate 115200, set send with Newline or Both NL & CR.
 5. Check the Voice Recognition Module settings. Input settings
    - Enter command: settings
    - Hit Enter to send.
 6. Train Voice Recognition Module.
    - To train record 0, enter command: train 0
    - When Serial Monitor prints "Speak now", you need speak your command
    - When Serial Monitor prints "Speak again", you need repeat your command again.
    - If these two voice commands are matched, Serial Monitor prints "Success", and "record 0" is trained
    - or if are not matched, repeat speaking until success.
 7. Repeat the process for each command i.e. train 1, train 2, train 3, etc
    - check out the config.h file for the order and phrases to follow
 8. Once all the commands are recorded, load and test the voice commands
    - To load all 7 voice commands, enter command: load 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
    - Speak the command to see if the Voice Recognition Module can recognize your words.
    - When recognized it will display the VR index
 9. If some of the commands don't work well, you can re-train until you're satisfied
 10. Training complete
 11. Follow the next section to enable autoloading of the trained recordings
 
#### Configuring Autoload feature
 1. Open the vr_sample_bridge sketch
 2. Set the correct RX/TX pins numbers to match your wiring
 3. Upload the sketch to the Arduino
 4. Open the Serial Monitor. Set baud rate 115200, set send with Newline or Both NL & CR.
 5. Enter command: 00
    - you should see output like: AA 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A
 6. Enter command: 15 7F 00 01 02 03 04 05 06
    - This tells the boards to autoload 7 records and which trained slots to load
 7. Enter command: 00
    - you should see output like: AA 08 00 00 00 00 00 7F 00 0A

If you can't get the autoload feature configured, you could uncomment code in the EasyVoice.begin() function
to manually load each record on startup. Recommend avoiding this if possible, it may slow the startup sequence
or have other unintended problems. That part is untested.

## Setup and Configuration
The component configurations can be easily customized by updating the values in config.h based on your components,
wiring, and audio tracks.

```c++
 /** 
 * Enable debug logging by uncommenting this line
 */
//#define ENABLE_DEBUG          1

// Comment out if you want to disable any component
#define ENABLE_EASY_AUDIO     1 //Enable audio 
#define ENABLE_EASY_LED       1 //Enable LEDs
#define ENABLE_EASY_OLED      1 //Enable OLED Display
#define ENABLE_EASY_VOICE     1 //Enable Voice Recognition Display

// Customizable ID badge for DNA Check sequence 
#define DISPLAY_USER_ID       "Dredd"

// Pin configuration for all momentary triggers

#define GREEN_LED_PIN         15

```


## Audio File Setup
The DF Mini Player will play back both mp3 and wav files. However, the program play
back tracks based on index. The index is determined by the order the files are loaded
onto the card. It also expects all files to be loaded into a sub directory on the card
called "/mp3".

When using a MAC to load files, it will create hidden files that will cause the playback
to seem like it's not working. You'll need to use the terminal window to rm all of these
files and directories from the card.

The audio file indices are listed in the config.h file. Do not remove any of the entries.
You can reuse sound effects for each slot with two options:
1. Copy the audio file in each slot where you want to use it
2. Change the index values below to match the files on the SD Card

I followed option 1 for the included audio files in this repo, it's just easier and there's
plenty of room on the micro SD card.
 
```c++
/**
 * Audio tracks by file index - upload these to the SD card in the correct order.
 */
#define AUDIO_TRACK_DNA_CHK         1
#define AUDIO_TRACK_ID_OK           2

Attach all the electronics module to the caddy in the following configuration. The MP3 and Amp are attached with double sided tape

![LG_Step2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196565141-8753ac42-8c2c-46cf-b68f-a2590719912c.jpg)

Screw the two caddy sides together

![LG_Step3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564199-51e519db-85a8-4f7e-8e12-b7436237ec56.jpg)

Insert the 4mm pin in the trigger and the switch as shown

![LG_Step4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564203-29632847-f151-4251-b1c7-d1f50001c898.jpg)

Screw the two haves of the trigger group together

![LG_Step5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564206-8b3ed467-11e6-4adc-a2cf-a323d205048e.jpg)

These are the parts for the slide

![LG_Step6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564212-4d36176d-8ce5-41d6-b623-3488231ffb0b.jpg)

Drill the switch holes out with a 3mm bit

![LG_Step7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564219-01b123f6-1fde-4243-b8b3-7f7209f41657.jpg)

The switch should stick out like this, you may want to give it a teeny bend to make it more clicky

![LG_Step8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564222-4f999ad6-aaf3-44b8-94a4-6294cf43f24a.jpg)

Insert the spring between the two posts, you may have to take some loops off, make sure theres enough tension that the it stays all the way closed when the switch is in

![LG_Step9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564232-62a43886-c756-4ae1-9766-3a7762f906c7.jpg)

Insert the guide rods

![LG_Step10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564255-c0b30643-8ce8-4805-ba54-be9a4f1c2760.jpg)

Trigger and switch are ready to go!

### Frame

![LG_Step11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564260-5beaa1b6-c257-4ca5-bf29-d92c0e69162e.jpg)
SCrew the LED in, you may have to sand the edge of the LED since some of them have bits that stick out from manufacturing

![LG_Step12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564263-616b7b00-113e-4b5b-ab02-bd36c8f2605e.jpg)
Insert the LEDs like this, make sure they'll clear the channel for the OLED retainer

You'll have to rock the switch in place to fit, it's very tight for a reason. Insert it from the front and snap it past the two posts, the edges are rounded for this reason. After screw it in place.

Inser the OLED and the OLED retainer, make sure the wires don't get caught when you slip it in. It's tight!

Rotate the release pin for the catch and insert the stopper in the hole to prevent the release from getting stuck.

Inser the 25mm lens into the barrel and the lens holder beside it, make sure the slot lines up

![LG_Step19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564288-53e39f27-9f6b-4efe-8d5e-97c3d727d782.jpg)
Power switch clicks into place, make sure on is forward.

![LG_Step20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564293-d903937d-2d7d-4314-9288-b51091454b69.jpg)
Solder the power to the switch AFTER it's in place, I also put double tape on the buck converter to keep it in place.

![LG_Step21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564298-9fd850ec-77dc-4a9c-89a2-4ff702a8185b.jpg)
Insert the battery this way up, it does go the other way but you won't have easy access to the charge port.

![LG_Step22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564306-5b2a807c-1489-41ec-9904-0ec74f85abc9.jpg)
Easy charge port access, you can screw the heel on now.

These 4 wires go through teh channel on the cocking mechanism and through this small channel, don't pinch anything! If the cocking mechanism isn't flush you have a pinched wire.

![LG_Step24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564320-5df52ffe-d69b-4f3f-95da-2ebba460adde.jpg)
All flush and snug don't force it unless you like resoldering ripped wires!

![LG_Step25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564321-8779a3f4-80e0-409d-bee6-2af271367c50.jpg)
Take the two havles of the caddy apart to connect the fire LED data wire, put it back together after

![LG_Step26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564322-2e080d83-e1b8-41d2-8ab9-d1e46b868c61.jpg)
Plug all the wires into the distrubution box and give it a whirl. This is your last chance to test it!

![LG_Step27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564323-1de1dbba-1256-480b-a71d-9e43f3aeb2d7.jpg)
The OLED connector goes here, stuffing it anywhere else will jam the top

![LG_Step28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564325-0e41367c-737a-4ed3-ab5c-5373dfaeaa6f.jpg)
See? Nice and snug

![LG_Step29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564327-b67882a7-925a-43cb-8ddf-3703b684bd52.jpg)
Inser the barrel and make sure the holes line up really well

![LG_Step30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564329-ceb0f94d-dfe4-4a43-b58a-d835e1df2d4f.jpg)
Put the front cover on and screw it together

![LG_Step31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564332-dddbacf1-6372-4f5c-9dde-2650f7906dc3.jpg)
Lining this little hole up from the top cover to the frame is important

![LG_Step32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564333-baca1f45-2f62-4077-bb66-59db9f5b0d8c.jpg)
Screw it loosly and slip the rear cover in place.

I will update this pic later, bullets go the other way up!, but just rest it here lightly to start

![LG_Step35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564339-f074fa33-d669-46df-b713-82617045e031.jpg)
Insert the side panel holder and the side panels then slide them all down as one unit. I had to 'slide it' with a small mallet.

![LG_Step36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564342-d5d5ff95-33c0-4b0a-b3af-babef59327bd.jpg)
Needs to be totally flush on top or the mag won't insert!

![LG_Step37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20442880/196564343-b9353c47-3593-4ab1-8736-55fac854fb98.jpg)
Pretty!
