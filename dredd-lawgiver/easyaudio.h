/**
 * EasyAudio is based on DF Player Mini, and provides simple setup, and easy track playback.
 * 
 * Constructor takes rx and tx pins as inputs, but will default to 0 and 1.
 * eg: EasyAudio audio(0, 1);
 * 
 * Call the begin function to initialize the serial comms, and set the volume.
 * Volume range is 0 - 30, default is 25.
 * eg.audio.begin(15);
 * 
 * Playback is by track index. The track index is determined by the order in which 
 * the files are loaded/copied onto the SD card.
 * eg. audio.playTrackNow(1);
 * 
 * When using in main loop, better to queue tracks for playback and eliminate using delays.
 * eg. audio.queuePlayback(1);
 * 
 * In the main loop, playback the next queued track:
 * eg. audio.playQueuedTrack();
